# Adding Life

## Basic Gameplay (D3.a)

I went about adding in some of the basic gameplay functions of this game. So the basics of drawing the map using DrawGrid which handles drawing the map grid along with adding tokens to the map. From there the spawnToken function spawns in the coins and gives each of them a handler for when they are clicked on. Then from there we have the gameplay side of things so the collect function handles collecting and whether or not the intention is to craft. From there if it is crafting then it goes to craftToken which creates a new token with the new value and places that token onto the map where the old token was however with the new value. With the use of various helper functions the code comes together to create the basic gameplay. For my cleanup however I went and looked at useless variables and removed them and then took repeated calls and either made them into helper functions (in the example of tokenCall) or made them global variables if they are called very often (such as playerLocation).

## Map Movement (D3.b)

This time around I added in movement controls so that the player can move about the map to collect tokens. I did this through buttons that I added into the UI that the player can click to move around and then added in functionality so that when the player moves it updates the position and allows tokens to be picked up once they enter into the interactive zone. I also updated map functionality so that when the map is moved around that tokens out of sight get despawned and tokens in frame do spawn however at the current moment it causes crafted tokens to be despawned and the ones already used to craft come back onto the map. But the game at it's current state places the player onto a random spot on the map and causes some map changes such as spots closer to the edges (North or South Pole) causes the boxes to elongate and thus need to be zoomed out to see the full area. For the cleanup this time around, all I really did was get rid of redundant logic and update some of the comments.
